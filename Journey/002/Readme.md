☁️☁️ We are still keeping things a little basic as it is only day 2 of the 100 day journey. It is necessary to understand the advantages of cloud computing, as it simply explains why cloud computing continues to be a trend and companies are migrating to the cloud. 


☁️☁️☁️ Cloud Research

So why are so many companies migrating to the cloud? There are advantages to cloud computing that make it a must for so many companies to adopt.

 ☁️ One of the most important and basic advantages of cloud computing is the concept of operation expenditure, or OPEX. This is the "pay as you go" approach, and allows companies to simply pay for the resources they use, and ONLY the resources they use. In contrast, if you were to have all you own datacenters and infrastructure, that would be Capital Expenditure, or CAPEX. In CAPEX, you pay for the upkeep of your infrastrucutre even if you are not using it. 
  
 ☁️ Another advantage is Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).

  ☁️Another major benefit of cloud computing is the scalability of cloud resources. Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.


☁️☁️It is important to understand the advantages of cloud computing as you learn more about cloud, as the advanages are some core concepts that define cloud and its capabilities. Some of these advantages include OPEX spending, scalability, high availability, reliability and predictability.
