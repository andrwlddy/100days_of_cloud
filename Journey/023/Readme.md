In its simplest form, a SIEM system enables you to:

Collect and query logs.
Do some form of correlation or anomaly detection.
Create alerts and incidents based on your findings.


Unlike with traditional SIEM solutions, to run Microsoft Sentinel, you don't need to install any servers either on-premises or in the cloud. Microsoft Sentinel is a service that you deploy in Azure. You can get up and running with Sentinel in just a few minutes in the Azure portal.
