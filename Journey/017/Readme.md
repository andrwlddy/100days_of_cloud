WHAT IS ZERO TRUST?

  Zero Trust is a network security strategy based on the philosophy that no person or device inside or outside of an organization’s network should be granted access to connect to IT systems or workloads unless it is explicitly deemed necessary.
  
  
ZERO TRUST HAS THREE MAIN COMPONENETS.....

VERIFIY EXPLICITY

This refers to not trusting a user, application, or anything accessing the netowrk via transitive trust. The indetity is to be confirmed by us, not someone else. 

LEAST PRIVELAGE
  
 This is a vital concept in security that means people should have enough privelages to do their work, and absolutley no privealges above that

ASSUME BREACH

Assume Breach is a mindset that guides security investments, design decisions and operational security practices. Assume Breach limits the trust placed in applications, services, identities and networks by treating them all—both internal and external—as not secure and probably already compromised.
