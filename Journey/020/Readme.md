## Introduction

☁️ (Why) Some exciting news!! I feel like I am close to taking AZ-900, Azure fundamentals certificaton. As mentioned in previous posts, it is my goal to get a couple of azure certifications under my belt during my 100 days of cloud journey. AZ-900 is not a prerequisite for any other of the Azure certs, but it is a great place to start if you dont have any experience with Azure ( Like myself)

So why VPN Gateways??

 I am going over VPN gatewways becaause they are a key part of Azure networking. Furthermore, this is where I have struggled on practice tests. So my next few posts will be Azure networking areas in hopes it helps me prepare for the AZ-900. 
 
 
 What is a virtual network?
 
 a virtual network is a network where software connects the network and devices all together. The location of the devices is irrelevant. 
 
 VLANs and VPNs are examples of a virtual network. 
 
    a VPN is a virtua private network, which allows you to connect to a secured network over the internet using encrypted connections
    
    a VLAN is a type of sub-network, that allows geographically disparate devices to be connected. 
    
 What is a VPN Gateway?
 
    VPN Gateway sends encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. You can also use VPN Gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway. 
    
 If a VPN Gateway is a type of Virtual Netowrk Gateway, are there other types?

YES!!

Each virtual network can only have one virtual network gateway of each type. When you're creating a virtual network gateway, you must make sure that the gateway type is correct for your configuration.

 The types are a VPN Gateway. and ExpressRoute.
 
 We will dive into ExpressRoute tomorrow!
