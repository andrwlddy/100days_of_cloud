MICROSOFT 365 INCIDENTS AND ALERTS


☁️☁️☁️ what is an incident?

Incidents are based on related alerts created when a malicious event or activity is seen on your network. Individual alerts provide valuable clues about an on-going attack. However, attacks typically employ various vectors and techniques to carry out a breach. Piecing individual clues together can be challenging and time-consuming.


    An incident is a collection of correlated alerts that make up the story of an attack. 

☁️☁️☁️ Managaing Incidents

You can edit the name of an incident, resolve it, set its classification and determination. You can also assign the incident to yourself, add incident tags and comments.

In cases where you would like to move alerts from one incident to another, during an investigation, you can also do so from the Alerts tab. Using the Alerts tab allows you to create a larger or smaller incident that includes all relevant alerts.


☁️☁️☁️ Microsoft 365 Defender is aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework.

☁️☁️☁️ Alerts

You can view all the alerts related to the incident and other information about them such as severity, entities that were involved in the alert, the source of the alerts (Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365), and the reason they were linked together.

By default, the alerts are ordered chronologically to allow you to first view how the attack played out over time. Clicking on each alert will lead you to the relevant alert page, where you can conduct an in-depth investigation of that alert.

☁️☁️☁️ MANAGE AND INVESTIGATE ALERTS 

Alerts are given a severity, which is defined below: 

Severity
High (Red) - Alerts commonly seen associated with advanced persistent threats (APT). These alerts indicate a high risk because of the severity of damage they can inflict on devices. Examples include credential theft tools activities, ransomware activities not associated with any group, tampering with security sensors, or any malicious activities indicative of a human adversary.

Medium (Orange) - Alerts from endpoint detection and response post-breach behaviors that might be a part of an advanced persistent threat (APT). This includes observed behaviors typical of attack stages, anomalous registry change, execution of suspicious files, and so forth. Although some might be part of internal security testing, it requires investigation as it might also be a part of an advanced attack.

Low (Yellow) - Alerts on threats associated with prevalent malware. For example, hack-tools, non-malware hack tools, such as running exploration commands, clearing logs, etc. often don't indicate an advanced threat targeting the organization. It could also come from an isolated security tool testing by a user in your organization.

Informational (Grey) - Alerts that might not be considered harmful to the network but can drive organizational security awareness on potential security issues.
