## AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY

☁️ Indentity and Access Management is essential to any service. Diving into Azure's cloud based IAM service is very important in understanding the basics of Azure, especially with security in mind. 


## Cloud Research

☁️☁️☁️ As previously stated, Azure AD is Azures IAM service. This service allows everyone (who is intended to) access the plethora of services and apps Azure comes with.

☁️☁️☁️ Azure AD Tenants are a very important concept to understand as well. Tenants are specific instances of Azure AD. So, for example, a company may have different tenants across its entire cloud environment, but typically smaller and middle sized companies will have one tenant for everything. 

☁️☁️☁️ We will come back to Azure AD as we go into more detail, and start studying for a more advance certification!
