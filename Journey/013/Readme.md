☁️ (What) We have learned about resources, resource groups, subscriptions, etc. These are all isolated instances in Azure. How do we get all of these to work together? How do we get VMs and databases to work together? The answer is Azure Virtual Networks. 




## Cloud Research

☁️☁️☁️

"Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure's infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation." (Microsoft Learn)

## Next Steps

☁️☁️☁️ We will build an Azure Virtual Network at some point!!! This would be a great way to combine everything we have learned into a final project. Expect this later on in our journey.
