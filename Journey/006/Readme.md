## Introduction

☁️ Previously we went over resources and resource groups. Now , we continue up the heirarchy within azure to subscriptions and management groups. I really do beleive the best way to think about it is a heirarchy, as this is the easies way to udnerstand how resources, resource groups, subscripotions and management groups relate to eachother. The photo above does a great job encapturing this heirarchy. 




## Cloud Research

☁️☁️☁️ Subscriptions

Microsoft defines a subscription as "an agreement with Microsoft to use one or more Microsoft cloud platforms or services, for which charges accrue based on either a per-user license fee or on cloud-based resource consumption"

☁️☁️☁️ Management Groups 

Management Groups are simply a way to organize your subscriptions. They are at a level above subscriptions, and can be stacked within eachother. 

☁️ Cloud Outcome 

we have gone over a lot of the basics, and will continue until we get outside of the first 10 days of learning. I look forward to more in depth projects!

To conclude, today we essentially finished off the heirarchy within azure that we started several cloud days ago. We know understand that resources are grouped into resources groups. Resource groups are typically grouped into subscriptions, which also define costs and what accounts are to be billed. If a company has many subscriptions, they can group subscriptions into management groups.
