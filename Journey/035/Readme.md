SOME ADVANCED FEATURES

☁️☁️☁️ Autoresolve remediated alerts
For tenants created on or after Windows 10, version 1809, the automated investigation, and remediation capability is configured by default to resolve alerts where the automated analysis result status is "No threats found" or "Remediated". If you don't want to have alerts auto resolved, you'll need to manually turn off the feature.



☁️☁️☁️Always remediate PUA
Potentially unwanted applications (PUA) are a category of software that can cause your machine to run slowly, display unexpected ads, or at worst, install other software, which might be unexpected or unwanted.

Turn on this feature so that potentially unwanted applications (PUA) are remediated on all devices in your tenant even if PUA protection isn't configured on the devices. This activation of the feature helps to protect users from inadvertently installing unwanted applications on their device. When turned off, remediation is dependent on the device configuration.

☁️☁️☁️Tamper protection
During some kinds of cyber attacks, bad actors try to disable security features, such as anti-virus protection, on your machines. Bad actors like to disable your security features to get easier access to your data, to install malware, or to otherwise exploit your data, identity, and devices.

Tamper protection essentially locks Microsoft Defender Antivirus and prevents your security settings from being changed through apps and methods.

This feature is available if your organization uses Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Cloud-based protection is enabled.

Leave tamper protection turned on to prevent unwanted changes to your security solution and its essential features.
