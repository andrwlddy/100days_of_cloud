☁️☁️☁️Azure Storage offers highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for a variety of data objects in the cloud



☁️☁️☁️WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF AZURE CLOUD STORAGE?

Durability and High Availability
Redundancy ensures that your data is safe in the event of transient hardware failures. You can also opt to replicate data across data centers or geographical regions for additional protection from local catastrophe or natural disaster. Data replicated in this way remains highly available in the event of an unexpected outage.

Security
All data written to an Azure storage account is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.

Scalability
Azure Storage is designed to be massively scalable to meet the data storage and performance needs of today's applications.
