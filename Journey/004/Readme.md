# Resources and Resource Groups 

## Introduction

☁️ (Why) The first 10 days we are sticking to the basics, sort of an introduction to azure and familiarzing ourselves. Today we look at the building block of Microsofts cloud, Resources. 

☁️ a resource is an entity managed by Azure. The most basic example being a virtual machine (vm). There are many types of resources azure offers. Some (but not all of them) include SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Ubuntu Server, a storage account, key valut etc. As you can imagine, to build up a network in azure, you will need many resources working together to accomplish your business needs. 

☁️Resources can be grouped together, in Resource Groups. This is a way to group the resources together for whatever purpose / reason makes most sense to accomplishing your goals. 

☁️Resource Groups can NOT be nested, and a resource can only belong in one Resource Group.

☁️Below is a screenshot of what you will see in azure after clicking "create a resource" in the Azure Portal. Some examples of the plethora of resource options azure offers!!!

☁️ Cloud Outcome

☁️ We kept it simple again today, reviewing the most foundational peices of azure, resources. We will continue to cover the basics and gradually get more and more in depth. 

## Next Steps

☁️ Actually creating a resource would be a fun idea for a day. Perhaps starting up a linux VM
