☁️☁️☁️ Setting up Data Connectors


Microsoft Sentinel ingests data from services and apps by connecting to the service and forwarding the events and logs to Microsoft Sentinel.

For physical and virtual machines, you can install the Log Analytics agent that collects the logs and forwards them to Microsoft Sentinel.
For firewalls and proxies, Microsoft Sentinel installs the Log Analytics agent on a Linux Syslog server, from which the agent collects the log files and forwards them to Microsoft Sentinel.
From the main menu, select Data connectors. This opens the data connectors gallery.

Select a data connector, and then select the Open connector page button.

The connector page shows instructions for configuring the connector, and any other instructions that may be necessary.
