## Introduction

☁️ Azure AD is one of the most important areas to know, understand and learn for Azure. users, groups, roles and permissions are all defined here. Mastering it is a must!!!!

Conidtional access is vital to IAM security in Azure. Here, you can (with a premium subscription that I dont have :() set conditional access rules for your resources. These are created with a condition followed by a control. (You can see two examples in the image above)


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

☁️☁️☁️ We dove a little deeper into some of the key pages in the Azure AD section of Azure today. We will continue down this path and continue to get more broad topics as well as some days that are more specific like today!

## Next Steps

IAM in Azure is someting that particularly interest me. So we may continue to dive into other IAM related topics
