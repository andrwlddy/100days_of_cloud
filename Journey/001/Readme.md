# SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL

## Introduction

✍️ The shared responsibility model is a core principle to cloud computing and needs to be fully understood before going into more complex topics.

## Prerequisite

✍️  Since this is one of the main principles of cloud, there really isn't pre-requsite knowlege needed. 
## Use Case

- ✍️ (Show-Me) As you can see from the image, the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) effects who is responsible for what in cloud computing. If this were on-prem, the customer would simply responsible for everything. Some things to notice...
-     1- The customer is ALWAYS responsible for information and data, devices connecting to the cloud, and accounts and identities.
-     2- The Cloud provider (i.e Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, etc.) is ALWAYS responsible for the phsyical infranstructure (hosts, network, datacenter)


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

✍️ While this is a rather simple concept, it is something critical to understand in cloud computing. As I study for the AZ-900 and take practice test, I realize understanding this concept is critical to understanding just about everyhting else.

✍️ Something that could be very helpful, and perhaps is something I will do for day 2 of the 100 days is going more specific into azure resources, and applying what weve covered today to those resources. For example.... Azure Virtual Machines. Where would they fall in, of these three different cloud service models? What about Azure MongoDB?
