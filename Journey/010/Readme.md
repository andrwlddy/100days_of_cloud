## Introduction

As we roundout the first ten days of this challenge, we will continue to keep it relatively simple. Since there are 100 days and plenty to delve into, I am intentionally keeping to the basics early on. It is my goal that while I continue to complete day after day, I am able to pass the AZ-900 and then move on to a more in depth certificaiton after that as well. 

Public, Private, and Hybrid clouds are the three main types of cloud. They each have advantages and disadvantages. 


☁️☁️☁️PUBLIC CLOUD

  This is the most common type of cloud. This is where a company like Microsoft, Google, IBM, Amazon etc. make computing resources avaliable on demand. This is the opex spending model we went into earlier in this challenge. 
  
  These resources are available to the general pulic. (anyone can go on Azure protal and spin up a VM in a matter of minutes). 
  
  The most common public clouds right now are Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). 


☁️☁️☁️PRIVATE CLOUD

This is a cloud environment but only for one specific company. This is more secure than pubilc, but also a lot more maintenance as this is CAPEX spending. All the infrstrucutre has to be paid in advance, and maintainged by the company that owns it. This is a lot like on prem from a cost and maintenance perspective. 


☁️☁️☁️HYBRID CLOUD

Hybrid cloud is simply when a company uses at least 2 different cloud environments. This is typically a public and a private cloud, but technically oculd be any two environments (could be 2 public for example)
 
☁️☁️☁️Multicloud 

This is when at least 2 public clouds are used. This is often confused with Hybrid cloud, however the main thing to remember is Multicloud is multiple public. Hybrid is any 2 environments
