 Introduction

☁️ Day 2 we briefly touched on resilency, or the ability of a system to stay up after experiencing challenges/faults. A key way azure is able to do this is Availability zones, and Azure Region Pairs

 Prerequisite

☁️ It would be beneficial to understand high availability and network resilience before reading this lesson



 ☁️☁️☁️Cloud Research

☁️ AVAILABILITY ZONES --- This is how azure makes sure high availability is maintained during any kind of system/infrstructure failure (local). Each availability zone has independant power, network, cooling, and is even in a geographically different place (even though typically still very close, i.e seperate building). 

☁️ AZURE REGION PAIRS --- This is how Azure make sure high availbaility is maintained during any king of large scale event. In the event an Azure region is compromised, its pair region (typically far away enough to not also be effected by a large scale event, but close enough for latency issues). 


 ☁️ Cloud Outcome

☁️ (Result) 
             
             Availability zones provide local redundancy
             
             Azure Region pairs provide geographical redundancy 
            
             NOT all azure regions have availability zones
