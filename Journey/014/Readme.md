## Introduction

The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework is very important for anyone considering or planning a cloud migration. Microsofts cloud adoption Framework is a guide to help you transistion to the cloud! A very difficult project is made easier with this framework. 

There are three main stages of the cloud adoption framework...

1- Plan
  Rationalize your digital estate (fully understand where you are before the cloud)
  Create your cloud adoption plan (prioritize workloads are defined and aligned with business needs)

2- Ready
  Cloud adoption is a strategic change that requires involvement from both business decision makers and end users.
  When you define skills and support readiness, create and implement a skills-readiness plan to address current gaps, ensure that people are ready for the change, and      define support needs.
  The process of creating your landing zone sets up a migration target in the cloud to handle prioritized applications.

3- Adopt
  Cloud migration is the process of moving existing digital assets to a cloud platform. Adopt is divided into two different options, migrate and innovate.
  Each cloud migration activity is contained during one of the following processes, as it relates to the migration backlog: assess, migrate, optimize, and secure.     Then, you manage each backlog asset.
Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio create tighter alignment with DevOps and accelerate innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.





## Key Takeaway

	The three main components of the Cloud Adoption Framework (plan, ready, and adopt) can be applied to different stages for cloud adopters. They should be revisited often because cloud adoption is an ongoing journey, not a destination.
