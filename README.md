## Andrew's Cloud Journey


☁️ I have started this 100 days of cloud challenge to commit myself to learning Microsoft Azure. I am currently studying for the AZ-900 certification and after that I would love to get another certification, perhaps an Azure security certificaiton. My goal is to get both by the end of the year

☁️ At the end of the challenge, I would love to already have the AZ-900, and potentially another certification as previously stated. I want to be comfortable and knowlegable on Azure and maybe even starting to look at AWS or GCP
